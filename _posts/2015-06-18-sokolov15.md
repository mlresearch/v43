title: Coactive Learning for Interactive Machine Translation
abstract: Coactive learning describes the interaction between an online structured
  learner and a human user who corrects the learner by responding with weak feedback,
  that is, with an improved, but not necessarily optimal, structure. We apply this
  framework to discriminative learning in interactive machine translation. We present
  a generalization to latent variable models and give regret and generalization bounds
  for online learning with a feedback-based latent perceptron. We show experimentally
  that learning from weak feedback in machine translation leads to convergence in
  regret and translation error.
