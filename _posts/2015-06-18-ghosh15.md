title: Online Mean Field Approximation for Automated Experimentation
abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised online graph labelling method
  that affords early learning capability. We use mean field approximation for predicting
  the unknown labels of the vertices of the graph with high accuracy on the standard
  benchmark datasets. The minimum cut is the energy function of our probabilistic
  model that encodes the uncertainty about the labels of the vertices. Our method
  shows that it can learn early given any choice of experiments that may take place
  in the automated experimentation systems used for scientific discovery.
