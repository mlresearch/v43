title: Iterative Embedding with Robust Correction using Feedback of Error Observed
abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques of today are highly sensitive
  to outliers. Almost all of them are spectral methods and differ from each other
  over their treatment of the notion of neighborhood similarities computed amongst
  the high-dimensional input data points. These techniques aim to preserve the notion
  of this similarity structure in the low-dimensional output. The presence of unwanted
  outliers in the data directly influences the preservation of these neighborhood
  similarities amongst the majority of the non-outlier data, as these points ocuring
  in majority need to simultaneously satisfy their neighborhood similarities they
  form with the outliers while also satisfying the similarity structure they form
  with the non-outlier data. This issue disrupts the intrinsic structure of the manifold
  on which the majority of the non-outlier data lies when preserved via a homeomorphism
  on a low-dimensional manifold. In this paper we come up with an iterative algorithm
  that analytically solves for a non-linear embedding with mono- tonic improvements
  after each iteration. As an application of this iterative manifold learning algorithm,
  we come up with a framework that decomposes the pair-wise error observed between
  all pairs of points and update the neighborhood similarity matrix dynamically to
  downplay the effect of the outliers, over the majority of the non-outlier data being
  embedded into a lower dimension.
