title: Imitation Learning Applied to Embodied Conversational Agents
abstract: Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are emerging as a key component to
  allow human interact with machines. Applications are numerous and ECAs can reduce
  the aversion to interact with a machine by providing user-friendly interfaces. Yet,
  ECAs are still unable to produce social signals appropriately during their interaction
  with humans, which tends to make the interaction less instinctive. Especially, very
  little attention has been paid to the use of laughter in human-avatar interactions
  despite the crucial role played by laughter in human-human interaction. In this
  paper, methods for predicting when and how to laugh during an interaction for an
  ECA are proposed. Different Imitation Learning (also known as Apprenticeship Learning)
  algorithms are used in this purpose and a regularized classification algorithm is
  shown to produce good behavior on real data.
