title: Teaching iCub to recognize objects using deep Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: 'Providing robots with accurate and robust visual recognition capabilities
  in the real-world today is a challenge which prevents the use of autonomous agents
  for concrete applications. Indeed, the majority of tasks, as manipulation and interaction
  with other agents, critically depends on the ability to visually recognize the entities
  involved in a scene. At the same time, computer vision systems based on deep Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs) are marking a breakthrough in fields as large-scale image
  classification and retrieval. In this work we investigate how latest results on
  deep learning can advance the visual recognition capabilities of a robotic platform
  (the iCub humanoid robot) in a real-world scenario. We benchmark the performance
  of the resulting system on a new dataset of images depicting 28 objects, named iCubWorld28,
  that we plan on releasing. As in the spirit of the iCubWorld dataset series, this
  has been collected in a framework reflecting the typical iCubâ€™s daily visual experience.
  Moreover, in this release we provide four different acquisition sessions, to test
  incremental learning capabilities over multiple days. Our study addresses the question:
  how many objects can the iCub recognize today?'
