title: Human-Guided Learning of Social Action Selection for Robot-Assisted Therapy
abstract: This paper presents a method for progressively increasing autonomous action
  selection capabilities in sensitive environments, where random exploration-based
  learning is not desirable, using guidance provided by a human supervisor. We describe
  the global framework and a simulation case study based on a scenario in Robot Assisted
  Therapy for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This simulation illustrates
  the functional features of our proposed approach, and demonstrates how a system
  following these principles adapts to different interaction contexts while maintaining
  an appropriate behaviour for the system at all times.
