title: Visualizing User Model in Exploratory Search Tasks
abstract: We present our ongoing work on an interactive exploratory information retrieval
  system designed to explain to the user the reasons for its predictions and help
  the user to build a mental model to predict how the system will behave. Users indicate
  which documents interest them and reinforcement learning is used to model the user
  by allowing the system to trade off between exploration and exploitation.
